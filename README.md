# Goodreads Books

## Overview 
This project aims to analyze Goodreads Books to answer some questions about books, explore relationships among different factors that affect reading and rating processes, and developing a regression model.

### Project Description
The project consists of five main files (I am going to update them regularly and add new files if needed)

- 1_Preprocessing
- 2_Exploratory_Data_Analysis
